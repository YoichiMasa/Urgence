A long press on a contact can remove this contact from the emergency number. No action is obviously done on the contact itself.\r\nThe application is based entirely on the list of phone numbers existing in the phone.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/fensminger/Urgence/blob/master/doc/img/UrgenceParam1.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Call the main emergency contact ###\r\n\r\nThis button allows to call the emergency (for example, 112 or a privileged person). If in the settings of other contacts you have checked the SMS box, an SMS will be sent with your approximate location. And this SMS will mention to the person that you have called. SMS is sent 2 minutes later only if you press the button of the phone.\r\n\r\nIf \"Sending an SMS on try calling emergency\" is activated, one or more SMS are sent from the moment you press the main button. Nevertheless, the message would be less alarmist indicating that this is perhaps a mistake.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/fensminger/Urgence/blob/master/doc/img/UrgenceParam2.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Calling other contacts ###\r\n\r\nThe four smaller buttons are actually shortcuts to your preferred people to call them directly.\r\nNo SMS is send on this 4 buttons.\r\n\r\n## Future developments ##\r\n\r\nThis application is free and intended to remain so. Sources are available on github by searching on \"Urgence\".\r\n\r\nThe application was only tested on the emulator and on a Samsung Galaxy S2 on Android 4.0.3. Nevertheless, it should not be any problem to run on other phones. Feel free to send me a feedback on github.\r\n\r\nNext planned changes:\r\n\r\n- Improve \"look\" of the Widget.\r\n- Put the contact picture in the button widget's call.\r\n- Make the widget available on the screen lock phone.\r\n- Add option for directly calling the emergency without validation.\r\n\r\n"}
